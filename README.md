## Interest Outside Code 🤼 
   Beyond coding, I'm an advocate for health and fitness, with a strong affinity for working out. As a former state-level wrestler,
   I've developed the mental fortitude to prespire through any challenge, which has translated into my work in coding and life in general.
   Additionally, I have a strong passion for nature and the complex ecosystems that depend on it. This drives me to try and preserve its
   beauty and ensure a sustainable future where biodiversity and life flourish. 🚵
